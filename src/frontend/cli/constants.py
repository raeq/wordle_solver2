üéØ Welcome to Wordle Solver! üéØ

Choose your game mode:
1. üß† Solver Mode: You play Wordle and get suggestions
2. üéÆ Play Mode: Play against the computer
3. üìö Review Mode: Review previous games
4. üóëÔ∏è  Clear History: Delete all game history

In Solver Mode, you tell the app your guess results and get top 10 suggestions.
In Play Mode, the computer picks a word and you try to guess it!
In Review Mode, you can review your past games and analyze your performance.

  {yellow} = Yellow (right letter, wrong position)
  {black} = Black (not in the word)
