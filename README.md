## Installation

### From Source

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raeq/wordle_solver2.git
   cd wordle_solver2
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On macOS/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the package**
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

### Development Installation

For contributors and developers:

```bash
# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Show help and available commands
wordle-solver --help

# Start solver mode (get suggestions for external Wordle)
wordle-solver solve

# Play Wordle game in terminal
wordle-solver game

# Review game history and statistics
wordle-solver review

# Clear game history
wordle-solver clear-history
```

### Quick Start Example

```bash
# Start the solver and get your first suggestion
$ wordle-solver solve

Starting Wordle Solver...
Suggestion: SLATE

Enter feedback (G=Green, Y=Yellow, X=Gray): XYGXX
Next suggestion: ROUND
```

## Game Modes

### üéØ Solver Mode
- Get optimal word suggestions while playing Wordle on external sites
- Enter color feedback to refine suggestions
- Uses advanced algorithms to maximize solving efficiency
- Best for: NYTimes Wordle, Wordle websites, learning strategies

### üéÆ Game Mode  
- Play complete Wordle games directly in your terminal
- Random word selection from curated word lists
- Visual color-coded feedback and attempt tracking
- Game statistics and performance tracking

### üìä Review Mode
- Analyze your past game performance
- View chronological game history
- Replay individual games step-by-step
- Performance metrics and trend analysis
- Strategy effectiveness comparison

## Solving Strategies

Choose from 6 different solving algorithms:

- **weighted_gain** (default): Balances letter frequency and word commonality
- **minimax**: Minimizes worst-case scenarios
- **two_step**: Optimized two-step lookahead approach  
- **frequency**: Letter frequency-based solving
- **entropy**: Information theory-based entropy calculation
- **hybrid_frequency_entropy**: Combines frequency and entropy approaches

```bash
# Use a specific strategy
wordle-solver solve --strategy entropy
```

## Architecture

The project follows clean architecture principles with modular design:

- **üì± Frontend Layer**: Rich CLI interface with extensible design
- **‚öôÔ∏è Application Layer**: Game engine and solver coordination
- **üß† Business Logic**: Multiple solving strategies and game rules
- **üíæ Data Layer**: Word management and game history persistence

Key components:
- **Word Manager**: Advanced word list management with frequency analysis
- **Strategy System**: Pluggable solving algorithms with performance tracking
- **Game Engine**: Complete game logic with state management
- **Statistics Manager**: Comprehensive performance analytics
- **History Manager**: Game persistence and replay functionality
